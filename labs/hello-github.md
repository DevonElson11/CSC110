			<h2> Objective </h2>
			<p>
				To learn how to create and clone repositories, make edits locally, stage and commit the edits, and then push the edits to the cloud. Along the way we will also learn  how to add collaborators to projects and how to choose a copyleft license,

			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
			 	<ul>
					<li>A computer with an internet connection </li>
					<li>A web browser </li>
					<li>Git, the open-source version control software</li>
					<li>A GitHub account </li>
					<li>Access to a personal or school email account </li>
				</ul>

			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<ol>
				<li> 
					If you haven't already installed Git on your machine, please visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads </a> and download the appropriate version of Git for your operating system. You may keep all of the default settings.
				</li>
				<li>Once installed, please visit <a href="https://github.com/PeterAdamson/CS2043-StringSorter">https://github.com/PeterAdamson/CS2043-StringSorter </a> and look for the green clone button off to the right of the page near the top. Please click this button and copy the url that presents. This is the location of the Peter Adamson's StringSorter repo that we looked at in class. We're going to clone his repository.</li>
				<li> 
					<p>
						Open your Git GUI or Git Bash application and paste in the url of the repository to pull a copy of it to your computer. In the terminal this can be done by typing:
					</p>
					<code> git clone https://github.com/PeterAdamson/CS2043-StringSorter.git </code>
					<p> 
						If your clone is successful and no errors are reported, visit your new copy and explore and read the program files. We will compile the program soon, if we haven't already.
					</p>
				</li>
					Next, you will want to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. You will need to use your email address for verification purposes. When you are ready, go to the next step.
				<li>
					With your new account, please create an empty repository by pushing the green <em>new</em> button at your GitHub profile home page. Name your repo hello-world. Add a brief description and make sure to make the repo private to protect your privacy. Check the checkbox to include a README file. Add a .gitignore file for Java from the dropdown as well as a copyleft or copyright license that you consider appropriate for your code.	Then click create repository.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once your repo has been created, please clone it using the same method you used when cloning the StringSorter repo.
				</li>
				<li>
					With your new repo on your machine, please copy your HelloWorld project files into your local blank repository. You can use your HelloWorld project that was compiled on the terminal or the version that you built using your IDE (Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc)
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you are confident that all your files have been copied, please use either Git Bash or Git GUI to stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes to the GitHub server. Remember to include a commit message when you commit or Git will not allow you to issue your commit.
				</li>
				<li>
					Verify that your changes have been pushed to GitHub by visiting the repo site and inspecting the files. You could also check by cloning another copy of the repo to your computer to see if the updated files appear.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you've come this far, congratulations! You've successfully committed your repository to your Git repo!
				</li>
