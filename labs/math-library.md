			<h2> Objective </h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>To calculate what day of the week it is after so many days have passed.</li>
					<li>To calculate the circumference of a circle</li>
					<li>To calculate how much money in interest you earn based on a given investment after a certain period of time</li>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
				You will need the modulus operator (%), Math.PI, Math.E, the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = PI * d), the formula for continuously compounding interest A = Pe^(rt)
			</p>

		<section>
			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Step by step instructions on how to run the program. Tell where the code is, how to compile it, how to run it,  where any data resources or tooling required to run the program might be found and how to include or use it. Describe expected behavior. This section should mirror your standard README.md file for an open-source program.

		<section>
			<h2> Analysis </h2>
			<p>
				Talk about the meaning of the output, if it is correct and comprehensive,  what can be improved, extended, or generalized, why the output is as is
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				Add a closing summary about what was achieved or not achieved or what more can be done
