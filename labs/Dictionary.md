			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Your Word class should have 4 private member variables: name, definition, synonyms, and antonyms. Each member variable should be of type String. Each member variable should have a setter and a getter. Your dictionary program should contain 5 word objects and a user input loop that asks the user to type in a word. If the user types in the name of one of the 5 words, the program should display a nicely formatted dictionary output of all of the information about the word. The user input loop should continue until the user types: "I'm done"
