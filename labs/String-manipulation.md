			<h2> Objective </h2>
			<p>
				Write a computer program that compares two sentences to see if they are equal. The program should disregard differences in capitalization and should also disregard leading and trailing spaces at the beginning and end of the sentences. The program should also print out how many characters are contained in the String but only if the Strings are determined to be equal. The length of the String should not count the leading and trailing spaces.

			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
				java.util.Scanner, java.lang.String methods
			</p>

			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Write the computer program. Name the file and class StringManipulation. Make sure the program reads in two Strings, determines if they are equal, and prints out the length excluding leading and trailing spaces. When you are finished, upload the project to one of your GitHub repositories and share it.

			<h2> Example Output </h2>
			<p>
				<code>
					<pre>
===========================================
Welcome to the StringManipulation program!
===========================================
Please provide us with your first sentence:
> I'm a nice alien, I swear!

Please proivde us with your second sentence:
                       I'm a nice ALIEN, I swear!

It appears that both of these sentences are the same!

The length of the sentence is 26 characters!

Thank you for using the StringManipulation program! Bye!
					</pre>
				</code>

			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				You successfully compared two String ignoring case and leading and trailing spaces! What an achievement! This is something really useful to know when you have to do input validation on application forms! Please remember what you did here! Now go of on your quest to become a coding master, you've come so far, and still, there is much yet to do!
