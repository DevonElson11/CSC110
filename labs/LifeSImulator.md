			<h2> Objective </h2>
			<p>
				To write a computer program that accurately simulates all of your major life decisions.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
				String, Math.random(), if-else,, switch
			</p>	
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Step by step instructions on how to run the program. Tell where the code is, how to compile it, how to run it,  where any data resources or tooling required to run the program might be found and how to include or use it. Describe expected behavior. This section should mirror your standard README.md file for an open-source program.

			<p>
				A life well-lived.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Analysis </h2>
			<p>
				There are a lot of ways to go about writing the logic for this program. The design is very much up to the individual programmer. That being said, there are easy ways to write the logic and there are hard ways, choose wisely!
