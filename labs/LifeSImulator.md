			<h2> Objective </h2>
			<p>
				To write a computer program that accurately simulates all of your major life decisions.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
				String, Math.random(), if-else,, switch
			</p>	
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Write a computer program that steps a person through major life events. The major choices in life (inside the simulation) are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li> What will your job be?</li>
					<li>Will you save for retirement</li>
					<li> Will you marry?</li>
					<li> Will you have children? </li>
					<li> Will you follow rules or will you break them?</li>
					<li> Will you keep in touch with your friends?</li>
					<li> Will you meaningfully contribute to society?</li>
				</ul>

			<h2> Data </h2>
			<p>
				The choices and preferences of the user.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>
				A life well-lived.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Analysis </h2>
			<p>
				There are a lot of ways to go about writing the logic for this program. The design is very much up to the individual programmer. That being said, there are easy ways to write the logic and there are hard ways, choose wisely!

			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				 Congratulations you just wrote an interactive life simulator! In the process, you have mastered logical operators and conditionals!
