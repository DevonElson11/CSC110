			<h2> Objective </h2>
			<p>
				To write a computer program that accurately simulates all of your major life decisions.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Materials </h2>
			<p>
				String, Math.random(), if-else,, switch
			</p>	
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Write a computer program that steps a person through major life events. The major choices in life (inside the simulation) are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li> What job do you wish to have?
						<ul>
							<li>Business Man</li>
							<li>Artist </li>
							<li>Engineer</li>
							<li>Helping Profession</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Do you wish to marry?</li>
					<li> Do you wish to have children? </li>
					<li> Do you wish to follow rules or do you wish to break them?</li>
					<li> Do you wish to keep in touch with your friends?</li>
					<li> Do you wish to meaningfully contribute to society?</li>
					<li> Do you wish to save money or spend lavishly?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, we don't always get what we hope or plan for in life; in fact, more often than not we are treated to the unexpected. Your program will account for this using Math.random(). First your program will ask the person about their aspirations. You will want to start by asking the name of the person. Next you will ask each question above and catalog the answers. Note that there are only four choices for career. Based on their answers you will produce a life story for that person. The life story will be told in a paragraph that describes what happened in their life. The content of the text will be colored by how what they desired for their life contrasted with what eneded up actually happening. Developing this paragraph to be output to the screen will help you hone your logical operator and conditional statement skills. It will actually force you to master them.

			<h2> Data </h2>
			<p>
				The choices and preferences of the user.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Results </h2>
			<p>
				A life well-lived.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2> Analysis </h2>
			<p>
				There are a lot of ways to go about writing the logic for this program. The design is very much up to the individual programmer. That being said, there are easy ways to write the logic and there are hard ways, choose wisely!

			<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p>
				 Congratulations you just wrote an interactive life simulator! In the process, you have mastered logical operators and conditionals!
