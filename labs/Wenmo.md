			<h2> Methods </h2>
			<p>
				Design an API that can keep track of how much money users have in their account and facilitate the sending and receiving of money between users. You program should have two classes: A Bank class and an Account class. The Bank class should be responsible for creating, suspending, and sending and receiving money between accounts. The Account class should be responsible for keeping track of how much money a person has and contain two methods for withdrawing and depositing money to the account.
