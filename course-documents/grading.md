		<h1>Making the Grade</h1>
		<h2> Summary </h2>
		<p> In addition to the 80% of your grade from your three tests, 
				you have the opportunity to earn 20% of your grade by 
				perfecting the 29 skills listed below. For each skill,
				you start as a level 1 and can progress to a level 10.
		</p>
		<p> Every 10 levels you earn is worth one percentage point toward your
				final grade. You level up by completing assignments in the assignments
				directory. The number of levels each assignment is worth and which skill
				the assignment focuses on is listed on each document. 
		</p>
		<p> Because there are 29 skills that can be leveled up, there are a total
				of 29 percentage points that can be earned. The 9 extra percentage points
				can be used as extra-credit toward your final grade.
		</p>
		<p> There will be more assignments available for each skill than are needed to
				level up to level 10. This way you have the ability to choose the assignments
				that most appeal to you. You cannot earn more than a level 10 in any particular
				skill.
