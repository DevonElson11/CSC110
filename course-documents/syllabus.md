		<h2>Achieving your Grade </h2>
		<p>As specified in the syllabus, you will have 3 tests this semester that largely determine your grade in the class. The first two are worth 25% each and the final is worth 30%. That means 80% of your grade (25% + 25% + 30%) comes from your ability to perform in this medium.</p>
		<p>The other 20% comes from your performance on labs and other assignments. In this repo, under course-documents/skills.md, you will find a list of 29 skills that you will want to master by the end of the course. The way you master them will be by completing assignments tailored to each skill.</p>
		<p>Every student begins at level 1 for each skill. It will be your job to *level-up* each skill throughout the semester. As you complete skill-specific assignments, your level will increase. The maximum level for each skill is level 10. A level 10 is worth 1 percentage point toward your final grade. So if you earn a level 10 in twenty distinct skills, you will have earned 20% towards your final grade. Notice of course there are more than 20 skills. This is because you have the opportunity to earn 9 percentage points more than you need to in order to get full marks in the course. If you do more leveling up than necessary, those extra percentage points can help compensate for any bad test scores you might receive. </p>
		<p>I admit, this is likely a bit different from the way your grade has been measured in the past and might take some getting used to. But I assure you, it will feel a lot more fun, motivating, and challenging. You will see yourself trying to earn points rather than trying to avoid losing them! :) </p>
		<p>We will talk about the details of this process further in class. I'm sure you will have many questions!</p>
		<h2>Useful Tools</h2>
		<p>You should have the following items to help you during the class. They are not required per se, but having them will make everything a lot easier.</p>

			<li>A USB Thumb/Disk drive or other way of removing your work from the lab.</li>
		 	<li>A personal computer or access to a computer to do work outside of class (or a bluetooth keyboard for your phone and a text editor)</li>
			<li>A github account for getting access to the course materials</li>
