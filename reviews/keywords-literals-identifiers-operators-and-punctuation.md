	<h1>Keywords, Identifiers, Literals, Operators, and Punctuation </h1>	
	<p> 
		A computer program written in a language must be compiled to machine instructions. In order for the program to be interpretted and converted from human words to machine symbols, the compiler looks for certain patterns in the program's sentence structure. The structure of the program's sentences apart from the content is called its syntax. Breaking the program up according to the language's syntax is called parsing. The parser breaks the language up into a tree and assigns each unit of meaning in the program a symbol. This is called tokenizing.

	<p>
		In computer programs, the text is broken up into five different kinds of tokens:
		<dl>
			<dt> Keywords </dt>
			<dd> These are words like public, class, and void. They are reserved as special by the compiler and cannot be used except as an indication to begin certain courses of action in a program. </dd>
			<dt> Identifiers </dt>
			<dd> These are user defined words that take on special meaning in the context of the program. When programmers name their own variables, functions, and classes (for instance, the class HelloWorld and the function prinln()), these newly named entities become identifiers. </dd>
			<dt> Literals </dt>
			<dd> These are things like numbers and Strings. 66, 72, and "The Man in the High Castle" are all examples of literals. They are just values or data used by the program that are explicitly described in the program itself.
			</dd>
			<dt> Operators </dt>
			<dd> These are special symbols for performing manipulations on identifiers and literals. You can actually just think of operators as special functions that get to be written using a special notation (infix notation). 
			</dd>
			<dt> Punctuation </dt>
			<dd> These are symbols such as semicolins (;) and parentheses () and curly braces {} that indicate special movement in the structure of the program. These punctuation marks can signal the end of a sentence, the start or end of function or class definition, or the evocation of a function.
			</dd>
