<h1> Lecture 3 </h1>
<h2> Meeting Notes: </h2>
<ul>
	<li> We took roll call.</li> 
	<li> We began discussing the labs that we have so far covered and talked about what labs we will be covering. The comprehensive list is located at <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/assignments-list.md"> assignments-list.md </a> </li>
  <li> We also discussed when are next test is and what will be on it. The test will be on October 19th in accordance with our <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/course-documents/semester-schedule.md"> schedule </a></li>
  <li> The skills that we have focused on and that you should know for the first test are:
      <ul>
        <li> Screen output with print() and println() </li>
        <li> User input with Scanner, nextLine(), nextInt(), nextDouble(), nextChar() </li>
        <li> Strings, ==, .equals(), trim(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), </li>
        <li> Typecasting, Integer.parseInt(), Double.parseDouble(),Integer.valueOf(), Double.valueOf(), String.valueOf(), Character.toString()</li>
        <li> Math.ceil(), Math.pow(), Math.floor(), Math.random(), Math.PI, Math.E, Math.sin() </li>
        <li> Variables: primitives vs. objects, declaring variables, defining variables, updating variables </li>
        <li> Variable Types: int, double, String, char, Scanner, float, byte, short, long, final </li>
        <li> Control Structures: if-else, if-else-if, switch() </li>
        <li> Operators: +, -, /, *, %, ++, --, !, !=, ==, <=, >=, <, >, ||, &&, +=, -= </li>
        <li> Loops: while loop, for loop </li>
        <li> Files: Read a file, write to a file </li>
       </ul>
   <li> We went on to discussing <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/reviews/loops.md"> loops </a> </li>
   <li> There are two kinds of loops we'll be concerned with: while loops and for loops </li>
   <li> We talked about how the best way to approach looping is to write the program so that it works for a single case without looping and then to wrap the repeating code inside a loop block. We used this <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/Loops.java">loop example </a>. </li>
   <li> We introduced the for loop as a way to do something when we know that it will happen for a set number of times. We used this <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/ForLoop.java">ForLoop.java code </a> </li>
   <li> After this we talked did our lab, <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/labs/LifeSImulator.md">LifeSimulator</a>, which focuses on <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/reviews/control-structures.md">control structures </a> such as <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/IfElse.java">if-else </a> and <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/LogicalOperators.java">logical operators</a> </li>
   <li> There was also a second lab focusing on the <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/MathLib.java">Math library </a>. This lab was titled <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/labs/math-library.md">math-library.md </a> </li>
   <li> In the second half of the day, we went over how to read from a file both a <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/Files.java">user-provided file</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/FilesSimplified.java"> particular hard-coded file </a></li>
   <li> We also clarified the difference between <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/reviews/%3D%3Dvs.equals()">==</a> and <a href="">.equals()</a> for Strings and talked about <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/reviews/constants.md">Constants</a></li>
   <li> Finally, we built a <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/examples/LifeSimulator.java"> template for the LifeSimulator lab </a> as it is much larger than what you've been used to working on. You can use this as a skeleton for your final result </li>
</ul>
