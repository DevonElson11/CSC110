<h1> Lecture 1 </h1>
<h2> Meeting Notes: </h2>
<ul>
	<li> We met and covered the basic mechanics of the class </li>
	<li> We talked about what a computer is and what an algorithm is </li>
	<li> We talked about what a programming language is and what it is for </li>
	<li> We made our first computer program in Java using both the command line and an IDE</li>
	<li> We downloaded a random stranger's GitHub repository and tried to use it. We will try again next class ;-) </li>
	<li> We created our own GitHub accounts and our first repo </li>
	<li> We cloned our repos to our local machines and added our hello world program </li>
</ul>
<h2> Important Concepts </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Computers are machines that execute algorithms </li>
	<li> Algorithms are a step-by-step process that solve problems </li>
	<li> A computer is special because it can run any possible algorithm </li>
	<li> 
		<h2>Computers are composed of a few basic parts:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 
				<p> CPU - central processing unit </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Arithmetic Logic Unit</li>
					<li> Control Unit </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Input Devices </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Keyboards </li>
					<li> Mouse </li>
					<li> Microphone </li>
					<li> Camera </li>
					<li> Touchscreen </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Output Devices </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Monitor </li>
					<li> Printer </li>
					<li> Speakers </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p> Memory </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Main Memory (RAM) </li>
					<li> Secondary Storage (hard drive) </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Programming </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Computers execute algorithms by adding binary numbers together repeatedly</li>
			<li>Computers store all of their instructions and data as binary numbers </li>
			<li>Computers execute algorithms by running computer programs </li>
			<li>Computer programs can be written in primary binary instructions but this isn't very readable. Instead we have special languages called programming languages to make the task easier for people to do </li>
			<li> One such programming language is Java </li>
			<li> Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language. You will learn what this means as the semester progresses </li>
			<li> After a program is written in Java, it must be compiled to machine language before it can be run</li>
			<li> In Java, the JDK must be installed to run programs. We will discuss why next class.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Collaborating with Git </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Software can be backed up using a utility called git written by Linus Torvalds and his team</li>
			<li>The back up stores all previous versions of the code </li>
			<li>Git is decentralized, so everyone can have copies of the entire repository. This makes it easier for people to collaborate across the internet </li>
			<li>GitHub is a service that helps host git repositories in a centralized location to help people share open-source code</li>
			<li> Open-source programs are programs whose source code can be read and manually compiled (if desired) before using</li>
			<li> Free software can be free to use and also legally free, meaning that you can do whatever you want with it </li>
			<li> There are copyleft license to help keep your code free and open source once you distribute it.</li>
			<li>Git is a tool that GitHub uses. They are technically separate things. </li>
			<li>All of our code in class will be version controlled using git and pushed to GitHub</li>
		</ul>
