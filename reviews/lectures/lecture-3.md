<h1> Lecture 3 </h1>
<h2> Meeting Notes: </h2>
<ul>
	<li> We took roll call.</li> 
	<li> We went back over grading based on <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/course-documents/skills.md">skill levels</a> that are earned by completing <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/tree/master/labs">labs</a> </li>
  	<li> We checked out the <a href="https://bbhosted.cuny.edu/webapps/gradebook/do/instructor/enterGradeCenter?course_id=_1757397_1&cvid=fullGC"> grading hub on Blackboard </a> which shows your skill level progress </li>
  	<li> We reviewed print/println, Scanner, console output with escape characters, int variables, and the multiplication and addition operators </p>
	<li> Next we began our units on variable types and operators </li>
	<li> Once finished we began work on the <a href="https://github.com/free-monad/CSC110/blob/master/labs/operators.md">lab</a></li>
	<li> After lab we took an optional 30 minute break. We returned for the next lecture sequence on if-else and switch statements used in tandem with booleans and logical operators</li>
	<li> We next looked at a few additional operators ++, --, -, +=, -=, *=, /=</li>
	<li> We then went over how to generate javadocs and looked at the JDK Documentation</li>
	<li> Next we delved into the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">String class API</a> and the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html">Math class API </a> </li>
	<li> There was no extra required lab for the second lab. We used the second lab as time to catch up on any incomplete labs or an opportunity to approach any of the extra credit labs </li>
