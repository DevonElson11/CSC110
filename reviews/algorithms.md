<h1> Algorithms </h1>
<p>
	An algorithm is a set of rules that precisely define an operation for completing a task. Algorithms have been used since ancient times, but their first thorough treatment was published in a book in 825 AD by Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizm.

	Algorithms can take many forms. Having gone through school, long division or large number multiplication are probably two mathematical algorithms most familiar to you. I'm sure you have no trouble recalling the sequence of steps that you repeat over and over again to get a quotient or a product. Of course, you can write an algorithm for less mathematical goals such as hailing a cab or tracking how many miles you've walked or how to save money or even for playing your favorite song. There is really no limit to what you can apply the idea to. The ancients had algorithms for finding prime and composite numbers and drawing parallel lines and navigating ships.

In this class, we're going to be focused on implementing algorithms on computers by writing computer programs. In fact, it is the only thing that computer programs do. Computer programs are essentially just a set of instructions that are issued to a computer, and so by our informal definition (and the formal one), every computer program is an algorithm. Computer programs automate the execution of algorithms. Every time you run a program, you are making a computer execute an algorithm.

It is not a coincidence that computers execute algorithms. The concept of a computer was invented as a formal way for describing what an algorithm is. By definition, a computer is a device that processes algorithms. Algorithms are the central focus of Computer Science. It is essentially what computer science studiies. As you progress through this class, you will gain a deep appreciation for algorithms, their power, and their limits.

The formal definition of algorithm arose in the 20th century with figures such as Hilbert, Alonso Church, Alan Turing, Kurt Godel, and Tarski lighting the way. These pioneers invented algorithm processing machines designed specifically as theoretical devices for constraining and defining the processing of algorithms to once and for all determine what an algorithm was and was not. These theoretical mathemetical functions and imaginery machines existed long before any physical computer, but they are exactly the concept on which modern computers are based. Today's computers, all of them, including your cellphone, fitbit, and microwave are capable of the same universal algorithm computation as those early on-paper devices. Each computer can run any algorithm that any other can. In fact, any modern computer is capable of running any algorithm that can be imagined. If you can turn a task into an algorithm, a computer can complete it. In fact, the only things computers can't do are things that can't be turned into algorithms. In this way, all computers are equivalent. Being able to process any and every algorithms is essential to what it means for something to be a computer.
