What is Scanner?

The Scanner class represents a cursor that moves through a stream of data to keep track of your current position while you're processing that data. A decent visual metaphor for a Scanner object would be the cursor in a text editor. Scanner can be used to process user input or input from a file. You can call methods such as .nextLine() and .nextInt() and .hasNext() to move through and consume the information that Scanner is moving over.
