/*
What is an IDE such as NetBeans for? What would you have to do to write computer programs without using NetBeans/Eclipse/Intellij/etc?

IDE's provide a way to manage your code base as a single self-contained unit. It does debugging, building, compiling, and code refactoring for you. It also integrates with the remove code repository of our development team. Without the IDE you would have to manage all of these things by hand and write your code in a text editor without syntax highlighting.
