If we gave every computer the same amount of memory and were not worried about how long it took to accomplish a task, could all computers perform any calculation that any other computer could, why or why not?

Yes, all computers are equivalent in theory and practice by their very nature and definition. All computers are capable of executing every algorithm. There are some thing computers can't do, but anything that is impossible for one computer is impossible for all computers and anything possible for one computer is possible for any other.
