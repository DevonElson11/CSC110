/*
What are packages and how are they related to import statements?

Packages are modules for grouping code together. When you import packages into your program with the import statement, all of the code in that package becomes part of your computer program. It is helpful to store commonly used code in packages so that you can reuse them in many different programs instead of having to rewrite code over and over again. java.util is an example of a package. That is where the Scanner class code is stored.
